The dataset contains the following columns:

CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Age: The age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall, likely based on customer behavior and spending patterns.

The histograms above provide a visual summary of the distributions for Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100):

Age Distribution:

The age distribution appears to be somewhat bimodal, with peaks around the late 20s and late 40s. This suggests the presence of two primary age groups among the customers.
Annual Income Distribution:

The annual income distribution is fairly uniform with a slight concentration around the $50k-$75k range. The income spread suggests a diverse customer base in terms of purchasing power.
Spending Score Distribution:

The spending score distribution is fairly uniform as well, with a slight dip in the middle ranges. This suggests that customers either tend to spend very little or a lot, with fewer customers in the mid-spending range.

The boxplots above provide a clear view of the distribution and potential outliers in each feature:

Age:

The boxplot shows a few mild outliers on the higher end (ages around 65-70). However, the overall distribution appears fairly consistent, with the interquartile range (IQR) covering ages 28 to 49.
Annual Income (k$):

The annual income boxplot does not show any significant outliers. The distribution is fairly symmetrical, with the median slightly below $60k. The IQR spans from about $42k to $78k.
Spending Score (1-100):

The spending score distribution appears uniform, with no significant outliers. The median spending score is around 50, with an IQR from about 35 to 73.
Insights from the Visualizations:
No Major Outliers: There are no significant outliers that would require removal or special handling, meaning we can proceed with the dataset as is.
Diverse Customer Base: The diversity in age, income, and spending patterns suggests that clustering could reveal interesting customer segments.

The scaled features are now centered around a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations used by the K-means algorithm.

The "elbow" typically represents the point where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model's fit, indicating an optimal balance between model complexity and fit.
From the graph, it looks like the elbow occurs around 6 clusters. However, to make a more informed decision, we should also perform Silhouette Analysis.
The silhouette score peaks around 6 clusters, suggesting that these numbers might provide the most well-separated and meaningful clusters.
Since both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis indicate that 6 clusters could be optimal, we can proceed with applying K-means clustering using 6 clusters.
